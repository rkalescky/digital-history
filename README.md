# Text Mining as Historical Method
HIST 3368 (undergrad) / Hist 6322 (Grad)

Meets 3:00-3:50PM CT MWF                                            

Meetings in Spring 2020 will be partly synchronous (via Zoom), partly asynchronous (via Canvas discussion boards, etc.). 

### About the Course
Computer-powered methods are changing the way that we access information about society. New methods help us to detect change over time, to identify influential figures, and to name turning points. What happens when we apply these tools to a million congressional debates or tweets? This course -- which is appropriate to both computationalists as well as those with a background in the humanities (but not code) -- will teach students how to analyze texts and as data for evidence of change over time. This course is an introduction to the cutting-edge methodologies of textual analysis that are transforming the humanities today.

### About the GitHub Repository
The purpose of this repository is to provide resources for digital-history. It aggregates original Notebooks written by Jo Guldi or her research assistant, Steph Buongiorno, Notebooks written by Southern Methodist University's "Data Team" (Rob Kalescky and Eric Godat), and Notebooks written by scholars in the digital humanities. Authorial credit for copied/forked Notebooks is given in associated README.md files located in the Notebook's parent directory. All code copied/forked from others' repositories are subject to the author's original licensing, not the licensing of the present repository.

### About the Instructor: Professor Jo Guldi, PhD
When I was a PhD student living in Silicon Valley, something amazing happened: Google Books launched the first mass digitization experiment of its kind, releasing scans of the Harvard, Yale, and New York Public Libraries onto the web. I quickly saw that there was potential, in this textual data, for kinds of analysis that had never been attempted before. From that point forward, I helped to found the discipline of "digital history," and I have been applying myself to the study of how computational algorithms can help us learn new things about the past, the present, and ourselves.

I am also a historian of technology who is interested in questions about how we know what is true – whether new technologies or history give us the tools for discerning historical truth in a new way – and when official paper obscures more than it illuminates. My book on the importance of history as a tool for discovering truth, The History Manifesto, was recently named one of the most important books across all fields published in the last twenty years. 

### Time Commitment 
Here’s what’s expected of you in terms of weekly workload: By the stipulation of university accreditation programs, a 3-credit course requires 6 hours of homework and group work each week. Your work will typically take the form of: 
- 2-4 hr code
- 2-3 hr of reading (~50-100 pp)

Depending on how difficult the exercises and readings are for each student, the time required to complete assignments will vary. Any students with concerns about workload should reach out to Dr. Guldi

University guidelines stipulate that students should meet for 2 hr 50 minutes in class each week. In an online and remote class, our interactions will take the form of small group meetings, zoom breakout rooms, live lecture and discussion, pre-recorded lectures, graded discussions, and informal discussion and support via Slack. Structured interactions will be slightly tilted towards the beginning of the semester and slightly less heavy towards the end, when your focus will shift towards small groups.
